# Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster
> Building a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people
were more likely to survive?” using passenger data
(i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)

## Getting Started

* Two similar datasets that include passenger information like name,
age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.
* Dataset - 1 is titled `train.csv`
Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board
(891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not,
also known as the “ground truth”.
* Dataset - 2 is titled `test.csv`.
The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose
the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.
